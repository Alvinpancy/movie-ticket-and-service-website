It has been suggested that one may view
the human brain as a complex
yet highly efficient network that 
is composed of multiple anatomical 
regions [van den Heuvel and H. E.
Hulshoff Pol, 2010]. The advent of
advanced neuroimaging techniques
has enabled active research in
mainly three primary types of 
brain networks, including the
structural
network analyzed via the 
tractography of diffusion tensor imaging 
(DTI) [Hagmann et al., 
2007], 
the morphological network analyzed 
via structural magnetic resonance 
imaging (MRI) [He et al., 2007]
, as well as the functional network 
analyzed via electroencephalography
(EEG) [Mantini et al., 2007],
magnetoencephalography (MEG) 
[Stam, 2004], or functional MRI (fMRI)
[Achard et al., 2006]. Recently
, resting-state fMRI (rs-fMRI) based 
functional brain network analysis 
has gained a large amount of 
research attention for its unveiling 
of the topological patterns of human
brain networks “at rest” [De Luca et al., 2006; Greicius et al., 
2009; van den Heuvel and H. E. Hulshoff Pol, 2010]. 
In brain network analysis, graph
theory is a widely employed 
technique that decomposes a networ
k into a set of nodes and between-node 
edges. In a brain network, 
the nodes usually refer t
o different anatomical re
gions. Most rs-f
MRI studies have utilized the 90 anatomical 
regions as
defined
in the Automate
d Anatom
ical Labeling (AAL) atla
s [Tzourio-Mazoyer et al., 2002] to serve a
s nodes [Achard et al., 2006;
Achard and E.
Bullmore, 2007; Liu et al., 2008;
Salvador et a
l., 2005]. 
In addi
tio
n to the AA
L atlas, other type
s of anatomical atlases 
have also been develope
d for functional connectivit
y analyses [Faria et al., 2012; Lancaste
r et al., 2000; Maldjian et al., 2003]. The 
variation in a brain network’s to
o
logica
l properties (such as small-worl
dness), as induced by the variation in nodal 
definitions, has 
been a topic of contem
porary re
search interest. In the work of 
Wang and colleagues [Wang et al., 2009
], there is
a statistical comparison 


of the topological properties 
of the functional networks derived from the AA
L atlas and another
atlas that consists of
70 anatomica
l 
regions. While obser
ving robust smal
l-worldness and truncated po
wer-law connectivity degree distribu
tions in both networks, the study 
found significant difference
s in multiple topological parameters
between the two networks. Later, in the work of Zale
sky and colleagues on 
whole-brain anatomical networks [Z
alesky et al., 2010], a signific
ant dependence of brain n
etwork properties o
n the nodal scale was found. 
Therefore, how th
e brain is segme
nted has a great impact on th
e topological properties of a brain network.
More recently, 
Dan and colleagues [
Wu et al., 2016b
] have created 
a set of atlases
that have two ty
pes of anatomical definitions (Type I 
and Type II),
each of which consis
ts of five levels of whole brain se
mentations with each level linked through ontology-based 
hierarchica
ships [Djamanakova et 
l., 2014]. At the high
est ontology level (Le
vel 5), Type I defines 7 classical 
definitions of the brai
n ontology (telencephalon (right and l
eft), diencephalon (right and left),
mesencephalon, metencep
halon, and 
myelencephalon), wher


eas Type II defines 4 s
tructures that are more widely used
in clinical descriptions (hemispheres (right 
and left), 

cerebellum, and brainstem) [Wu e
t al., 2016b]. Such multi-granularity atlases, w
hen applied to rs-fMRI based brain net
work analyses, will 

thus define 10 types of brain network nodes. Wh
ether the topological properties of a resting state b
rain network will be affected by those 
10 types of multi-granularity no
dal definition and how will they be affe
cted are important questions to explore. Fo
r example, some network 
properties may or may not be independe
nt of the segmentation type and also the on


tology level, which can be considered as intrinsic brain 
characteristics in 
some sense, and some topolog
ical properties may be “inherited” from
previous levels within the same segmentation type. 
Examining such factors will gr
eatly further our understanding of r
s-fMRI based functional brain 
etworks.
